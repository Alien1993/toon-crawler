# Yet another wikipedia crawler

This one has kind of a silly story, I was kind of drunk and had a flash about an
old cartoon seen when I was a child about some fireflies, insects or whatever
they were, that could screw different colored light bulbs on their butt and danced
around in some old windmill or barn.

I kind of remember it was a Merrie Melodies from Warner Bros or something like that
so I tried looking on Wikipedia for a filmography, but it was way too long so I
wrote this to help me out.

Obviously it didn't, I could not find it. I'll keep searching somehow. If you have any info let me know!
